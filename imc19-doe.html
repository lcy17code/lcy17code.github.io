			<h2>An End-to-End, Large-Scale Measurement of </h2>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Traditionally, DNS packets are transmitted in clear-text. However, adversaries are actively exploiting this design to compromise Internet users' security and privacy. To mitigate such threats, several protocols have been proposed to encrypt DNS queries between DNS clients and servers, which we jointly term as DNS-over-Encryption. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We aim to understand the current status lf DNS-over-Encryption, by collecting data from Internet scanning, user-end measurement and passive monitoring logs. In general, the service quality of DNS-over-Encryption is satisfying, in terms of accessibility and latency. For DNS clients, DNS-over-Encryption queries are less likely to be disrupted by in-path interception compared to traditional DNS, and the extra overhead is tolerable. However, we also discover several issues regarding how the services are operated. As an example, we find 25% DNS-over-TLS service providers use invalid SSL certificates. Compared to traditional DNS, DNS-over-Encryption is used by far fewer users but we have witnessed a growing trend. As such, we believe the community should push broader adoption of DNS-over-Encryption and we also suggest the service providers carefully review their implementations.

				<p>Lately, protocols to encrypt plaintext DNS have been proposed to tackle with its privacy concerns. Based on large-scale data collection, we provide an early view on the current status of DNS-over-Encryption protocols. Specifically, we perform measurements on their deployment on open resolvers, their performance compared to traditional DNS, and their current usage by DNS clients.</p>

				<br />
				<p>We report and measure DNSIntercept, where DNS requests to public resolvers are surruptitiously redirected and handled by alternative resolvers. Using two client-side  measurement platforms, we find 259 ASes exhibit this hidden behavior. It also can raise security concerns as some alternative resolvers are weak at security practices.</p>

				<p>To build a multilingual Internet, Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) allow Unicode characters in the domain labels. On the other hand, IDNs face the same problem of abuse, like homograph attacks. We perform empirical analysis on the current registration status of IDN, and detect two types of IDN abuse.</p>

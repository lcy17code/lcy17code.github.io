			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Domain Name System (DNS) is the entry of everything on the Internet. As a basic infrastructure, DNS provides the translation of human-readable domain names to numerical addresses. Since its proposal over 30 years ago, the DNS ecosystem has evolved rapidly with several new features, and is as well facing new challenges. </p>
				<br />
			<h2>Our Team</h2>
				<p>We are the DNS research team at Network and Information Security Lab of Tsinghua University (NISL). We aim to better understand the current infrustructure of DNS, often with the support of large-scale data analysis.</p>
				<p>Our team members: Prof. Haixin Duan, Baojun Liu, Chaoyi Lu, Yiming Zhang, Mingming Zhang, Chunying Leng.</p>

				<p><strong>DNS-over-Encryption</strong></p>
				<p>Lately, protocols to encrypt plaintext DNS have been proposed to tackle with its privacy concerns. In this paper we provide an early view on the current status of DNS-over-Encryption protocols. Based on large-scale data, we perform measurements on its server deployment, client usability and real-world usage. </p>

				<p><strong>DNS Interception</strong></p>
				<p>We report and measure DNSIntercept, where DNS requests to public resolvers are surruptitiously redirected and handled by alternative resolvers. </p>

				<p><strong>IDN and its abuse</strong></p>
				<p>To build a multilingual Internet, Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) allows Unicode characters in the domain labels. On the other hand, IDNs face the same problem of abuse, like homograph attacks. From public TLD zone files we show that IDN registration has been steadily growing. </p>
